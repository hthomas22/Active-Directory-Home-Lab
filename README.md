# Active-Directory-Home-Lab

This project will give detailed instructions on how to setup a basic home lab running Active Directory.

The virtual machines will be created in VirtualBox by using the Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 iso images that can be found on Microsoft's website.

The network diagram was made using draw.io
