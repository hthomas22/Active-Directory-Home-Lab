# Active-Directory-Home-Lab

This project will give detailed instructions on how to setup a basic home lab running Active Directory.

Their will be 2 virtual machines that we create in VirtualBox, using the Windows Server 2019 and the Windows 10 iso images that can be found on Microsoft's website.

The following network diagram was made using draw.io, and it gives an overview of how this network would be setup to function with an organizaiton.

The group of VM's is simulating the "office" of computers that would be used by employees for everyday tasks.
The "Client 1" computer is the computer we will be using as the system administrator for the Active Directory environment.

The Server will need to
** IP Addresses


The IP range I will be using for this project is 172.16.0.100 - 172.16.0.200 which will have a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, giving us a maximum of 256 subnets with 254 possible hosts per subnet. 

To properly setup the virtual machines, we need to make sure the network adapter settings are configured correctly.

Because all of the devices will be contained in virutal machines on the same computer, including the server, we are going to edit the DNS of the machine that houses the server to
